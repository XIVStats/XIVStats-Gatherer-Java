# XIV Stats Gatherer (Java) #

[![Build Status](https://ci.reidweb.com/job/XIVStats/job/XIVStats-Gatherer-Java/job/master/badge/icon)](https://mygitlab.org:4043/job/XIVStats/job/XIVStats-Gatherer-Java/job/master/)

XIVStats Gatherer Java is a multi threaded Java program with the purpose of
fetching a set of character profiles from the
[Final Fantasy XIV Lodestone](http://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/), and
then parse the content of the character profile page before passing it into a
database (MySQL or PostgreSQL).

To see an example of data gathered using this script see
[FFXIVCensus.com](http://ffxivcensus.com/). The database generated by this program
can be used in conjunction with the [XIVStats PHP Script(s)](https://github.com/xivstats/xivstats)
to produce a web page displaying statistics for the data gathered.

## Quick Start
Follow these steps to setup XIVStats-Gatherer-Java:

### 1. Database setup
  1. Setup your own [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/installing.html)
   or [PostgreSQL](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)
  server instance (if you have not already done so).
  2. Setup a database to store the program data in:
    ```sql

    CREATE DATABASE dbplayers;
    ```
  3. Create a user for the program to use to connect to the database.

  **Replace {password} with your choice of password, take a note of this for later.**
  ```sql
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dbplayers.* TO `xivstats`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY '{password}';
  ```

### 2. Program Setup
  1. Install the latest version of either [OpenJDK 8 JRE](http://openjdk.java.net/install/)
  or [Oracle JRE ](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
  (if you have not already done so).
  2. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/XIVStats/XIVStats-Gatherer-Java/releases).
  3. Extract the zip to the directory you wish to install to.
  4. If this is your first time setting up the program - rename the file ```config_example.xml```
  to ```config.xml```.
  5. Open ```config.xml``` in editor of choice.
  6. Configure the options as follows
      * Set the ***url*** parameter to the URL of your SQL server instance, MySQL default: ```mysql://localhost:3306```, PostgreSQL default: ```postgresql://localost:5407```.
      * Set the ***database*** parameter to the database you configured earlier (```dbplayers```).
      * Set the ***username*** parameter to the username you configured earlier (```xivstats```).
      * Set the ***password*** parameter to the password you configured earlier.
      * Set the ***threads*** parameter to the number of threads you want the program to utilize (more threads = faster gatherer crawls). At present there is a safety limit of 64.
  7. Save and close ```config.xml```.
  8. Using a shell (or CMD on windows) run the following command (replace
    {words in brackets} with integer parameters):
  ```shell
  java -jar XIVStats-Gatherer-Java.jar -s {lowest character id to fetch} -f {highest character id to fetch}
  ```
  The application can be run with the following command line options/args:

  | Short option | Long option           | Argument type  | Description                                                          |

  |-h            | --help                | none           | display help message                                                 |
  |-m            | --store-mounts        | none           | store mount data set for each player into the database               |
  |-P            | --store-minions       | none           | store minion data set for each player into the database              |
  |-p            | --password            | String         | database user password                                               |
  |-s            | --start               | integer        | the character id to start from (inclusive)                           |
  |-t            | --threads             | integer        | number of gatherer thrads to running                                 |
  |-u            | --user                | String         | database user                                                        |
  |-U            | --url                 | String         | the database URL of the database server to connect to                |
  

  Note: On Linux/Unix it is advised to run the program in Tmux/Screen or similar.
  
## Logging
Running the JAR will generate 2 log files, in a ```/.ffxivcensus/``` folder in the user's home directory.
There are 2 log files produced:
- ```gatherer.log```
    - A record of all debug logging generated during the gathering run
- ```progress.log```
    - A simple per-character result log to enable tracking of progress
    - _Note: As characters are threaded, there is no guarantee the characters will be presented in this log in sequential order_

Logs are currently overwritten with each run, so in the even you wish to save a log file, please re-name or copy the desired file for later review.

## XIVStats-Gatherer-Ruby
XIVStats-Gatherer-Java provides the same functionality as the original ruby-based  [XIVStats-Gatherer-Ruby](https://github.com/XIVStats/XIVStats-Gatherer-Ruby),
but is written in Java to make use of Multi-threading capabilities that could
not be harnessed in Ruby. This allows XIVStats-Gatherer-Java to perform large
crawl operations in a much shorter period of time, utilizing only one application
instance. XIVStats-Gatherer-Java also brings with it the benefit of being able
to use a full SQL setup as opposed to a sqlite file, giving the advantage of
being able to perform asynchronous database transactions.
